of the things we love. I <a href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/quitlit/>quit my tenure-track academic
position</a> in January, and had to let go of my academic career,
the foundation of my identity for at least the last decade and a half of my life
(and if I&rsquo;m being honest, probably longer than that). We all collectively had to
let go of the brief and delicious summer months where it looked like our Covid
vaccines would allow us to get back to living like we had in the before times.
I had to let go of the season of racing cyclocross that I had diligently trained
all year for, after I managed to crash myself out of the very first race of the
season <em>while warming up</em>. I was off the bike for a month with an MCL sprain.</p><p>Harder still, we suddenly had to let go of my cat Freya, who&rsquo;s been a constant
companion through the last 10 years, seeing me through my PhD, a breakup, a move
to NJ, another move to another part of NJ, the tumultuous first few years of the
tenure track, the tumultuous <em>end</em> of my tenure track, and, finally, yet
another move. I still am regularly convinced that I hear her yowling
murderously out the window, nearly six months after her kidneys suddenly gave
out.</p><p>And, of course, there was my mom&rsquo;s cancer.</p></div><div class=post-more><a href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/a-year-of-letting-go/>more →</a></div></li><li><div class=post-header><a class=post-title href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/remote-julia/>Remote emacs+Julia workflow</a><div class=post-date>14 Apr 2021</div></div><div class=post-summary><p>In my role at <a href=https://beacon.bio>Beacon</a>, I spend most of my working day

This project was done with R, which makes it really easy to automatically
generate citations for packages. With just a bit of glue code you can
automatically generate in-text citations, too.</p></div><div class=post-more><a href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/how-to-cite-your-code/>more →</a></div></li><li><div class=post-header><a class=post-title href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/scraping-brewtoad/>Web scraping with Julia</a><div class=post-date>21 Dec 2018</div></div><div class=post-summary><p>One of my grad school procrastination projects was learning how to brew beer. I
started off using a website called Hopville to keep track of the recipes I
brewed, until they were acquired in 2013 by
<a href=https://www.brewtoad.com>Brewtoad</a>. Both sites provided a really convenient
way to play around with recipe ideas, learn from others, and keep track of how
each step of each brew went which was really helpful as a beginner.</p><p>Now, just five years later, Brewtoad is <a href=https://www.brewtoad.com/shutdown>shutting
down</a>.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> With no way to easily
grab an archive of the dozens of recipes and brew logs I&rsquo;ve saved on the site,
and no public API.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> So, the only remaining option is to go through and
download the HTML for each page, one-by-one. I <em>could</em> do that myself but I
<del>don&rsquo;t have time for that</del> think that&rsquo;s a task more appropriate for a
computer. So I wrote a <a href=https://github.com/kleinschmidt/brewtoad-scrape.jl>Julia
script</a> to scrape a user&rsquo;s
recipes and brew logs.</p></div><div class=post-more><a href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/scraping-brewtoad/>more →</a></div></li><li><div class=post-header><a class=post-title href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/cite-code/>Cite your code!</a><div class=post-date>12 Dec 2018</div></div><div class=post-summary><p>TL;DR: <strong>cite the software you use in your research!</strong></p><p>In lab meeting the other day someone asked what the major R packages for
analyzing psycholinguistic data are, and I had a hard time thinking of
any.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> That made me think about <em>why</em> software is such a small part of
our scholarly output. Part of the reason might simply be that there&rsquo;s not
enough overlap in the specific kinds of analyses we do to justify creating brand
new packages, rather than using domain-general tools (like the
<a href=https://tidyverse.org>tidyverse</a>).</p><p>But I think there may be a deeper explanation: it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em> to write good, useful
software, and academia does not reward that particular kind of hard work.</p></div><div class=post-more><a href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/cite-code/>more →</a></div></li><li><div class=post-header><a class=post-title href=https://www.davekleinschmidt.com/blog/hello-world/>Hello World</a><div class=post-date>17 Oct 2018</div></div><div class=post-summary><p>Why a blog?
