    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: <strong>cite the software you use in your research!</strong></p>

<p>In lab meeting the other day someone asked what the major R packages for
analyzing psycholinguistic data are, and I had a hard time thinking of
any.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ignorance"><a href="#fn:ignorance">1</a></sup> That made me think about <em>why</em> software is such a small part of
our scholarly output.  Part of the reason might simply be that there&rsquo;s not
enough overlap in the specific kinds of analyses we do to justify creating brand
new packages, rather than using domain-general tools (like the
<a href="https://tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>).</p>

<p>But I think there may be a deeper explanation: it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em> to write good, useful
software, and academia does not reward that particular kind of hard work.</p>

<p>Designing, implementing, and maintaining software packages is
difficulty at best and downright consuming at worst.  Being involved with
developing and maintaining some of the
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaStats">JuliaStats</a> packages has shown me how much work
and energy goes into just providing support to users and keeping things from
breaking as the language changes and other packages are updated.  And, if I&rsquo;m
being honest, the packages of my own research code that I&rsquo;ve released
(<a href="https://github.com/kleinschmidt/beliefupdatr"><code>beliefupdatr</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kleinschmidt/phondisttools"><code>phondisttools</code></a>) are not
particularly well-crafted.  I basically pushed them out the door when I
submitted the papers behind them in the spirit of openness and the hope that
they might be useful to someone else.  And I think they have been!  But they
could be so much <em>better</em>&mdash;more flexible, ergonomic, intuitive,
integrated&mdash;and if they were I suspect their utility would be much greater.  Of
course, I fix problems, bugs, and incompatibilities with new versions of R as
they come up, but I barely have time for that.  Making a
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl">package</a>
<a href="https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">that</a>
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl">is</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr">truly</a>
<a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2">useful</a> to other people requires a huge
amount of careful, laborious work to design and implement.</p>

<p>As an academic&mdash;especially those at the junior professor stage, as I am
now&mdash;you are constantly faced with competing demands on your time and energy.
A major consideration is whether investing time in some activity will lead to
more of the gold stars which allow you to advance in your career.  Right now, in
my field, those gold stars are <strong>citations</strong>, and (at least if the conventional
wisdom is to be believed) any activity that does not lead to more gold stars
(citations) is, essentially, a leisure activity.  Absent any change in
incentives and from a purely careerist perspective (which I don&rsquo;t necessarily
endorse), it&rsquo;s not worth it to me to spend the time to develop useful software.
So, what do we get?  A lot of cobbled-together one-off scripts and notebooks,
useful only for the project at hand, guided by oral tradition/lab culture, and
(hopefully) dumped on the internet in a well-intentioned attempt at openness.</p>

<p>Which brings me the take-home message of this post: <strong>cite the software you
use</strong>.  This is <em>especially</em> important if that software is open-source software.
Citing software is important for a lot of reasons, not least of which is that it
feels <em>good</em> to see your software acknowledged as useful in such a public forum,
and developing open source software can often feel like a <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/">thankless
slog</a>.
But there are two reasons I want to highlight here.  First, you&rsquo;re rewarding the
people who write and maintain that software, in a way that for your fellow
academics will <em>directly</em> help them get a job, tenure, or a promotion.  Second,
by citing software you treat it just like any other piece of intellectual labor
you&rsquo;re building on to do your work, and in doing so you normalize the idea that
good software <em>is</em> useful intellectual labor which should be valued and
encouraged by the academy.</p>

<p>Of course, not all code you write is <em>software</em>, in the sense of a product
that&rsquo;s usable by a third party for a task that may be very different than you
originally intended.  But my hunch is that there&rsquo;s a lot of very useful software
hiding out there in bits of one-off research code,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:julia"><a href="#fn:julia">2</a></sup> and that if we rewarded
academics <em>at all</em> for doing the work to take that one-off code over the top to
being useful software we&rsquo;d collectively save ourselves a lot of
wheel-reinventing.  So, if you use software, cite it.  If you&rsquo;re using an
<code>R</code> package, you can get a citation with <code>citation</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">citation<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;rmarkdown&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">To cite package ‘rmarkdown’ in publications use:

  JJ Allaire, Yihui Xie, Jonathan McPherson, Javier Luraschi, 
  Kevin Ushey, Aron Atkins, Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng and Winston
  Chang (2018). rmarkdown: Dynamic Documents for R. R package
  version 1.10. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

  @Manual{,
    title = {rmarkdown: Dynamic Documents for R},
    author = {JJ Allaire and Yihui Xie and Jonathan McPherson and 
      Javier Luraschi and Kevin Ushey and Aron Atkins and Hadley
      Wickham and Joe Cheng and Winston Chang},
    year = {2018},
    note = {R package version 1.10},
    url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown},
  }</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, I should be clear that I&rsquo;ve been remiss in citing the software I use.
I&rsquo;m trying to do better but it&rsquo;s hard to form new citation habits!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why a blog?  Because why not.</p>

<p>Like the rest of this site, it&rsquo;s powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a static
site generator powered by Go templates.  The content of each page is written in
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a>, and rendered
into HTML by a series of hand-crafted templates and CSS.</p>

<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>

<p>These templates and CSS are an organic outgrowth of this site&rsquo;s past as a bunch
of HTML and CSS that I hacked together because someone told me I needed to have
a website when I was applying to grad school.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:gh-orig"><a href="#fn:gh-orig">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Because I <del>had abundant free time in grad school</del> love procrastinating, when I
moved the site from our department&rsquo;s FTP server to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github
pages</a>, I also refactored the site to generate some
of the repetitive boilerplate HTML using templates.  I chose Jekyll because it&rsquo;s
natively supported by Github pages (so not build step is required), and because
it&rsquo;s natural to write content for a Jekyll site directly in HTML which meant
there was no need to mess with my artisinal, handcrafted HTML
content.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:gh-jekyll"><a href="#fn:gh-jekyll">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Eventually, I <del>finished my PhD and had a ton of time on my hands</del> was
procrastinating and decided it was time to properly refresh the site.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:gh-hugo"><a href="#fn:gh-hugo">3</a></sup>
I decided to look at Hugo because it was the new hotness and because it&rsquo;s
powered by Go templates which provide a lot of power.  I wanted to do things
like generate a nicely formatted <a href="/work/">list of papers</a> from some
bibliographic data.  Hugo is also more opinionated about the content being in
markdown which is a position I was coming to appreciate more and more.  Markdown
is a great format for both reading and writing structured text, and I was
starting to get sick of editing HTML by hand whenever I wanted to update
something.</p>

<p>The downside of Hugo is that it&rsquo;s not natively supported on Github pages, but
needs to be run to generate the HTML files that actually get hosted.  If I
didn&rsquo;t know any better, I would have to just do this manually and commit all the
generated HTML before updating the Github repository.  But fortunately, since
becoming more involved with open source projects I&rsquo;ve learned a bit more about
continuous integration.  So I was able (with some thrashing about) to figure out
how to automatically render and deployed the site with
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/kleinschmidt/kleinschmidt.github.io">Travis</a>.  If you
yourself don&rsquo;t want to mess around with that, <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>
provides a great hosting and CI service that includes Hugo, which makes it
much simpler to host a Hugo site.  I&rsquo;ve used this for another site I made with
Hugo.</p>

<h2 id="blogging-with-hugo">Blogging with Hugo</h2>

<p>Once Hugo was set up, adding a blog was straightforward: add templates for the
list of posts and a single post, and write posts as markdown files in
<code>content/blog/post-title.md</code>.</p>

<p>The first template is (<code>layouts/blog/single.html</code>), which renders the pages for
individual posts (like this one):</p>

<p>The other template is <code>layouts/blog/list.html</code>, which renders the list of posts

<p>The <code>nav.html</code> <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/">partial template</a>
renders the navigation menu based on the list of pages automatically generated
by Hugo, so all that&rsquo;s needed to add the &ldquo;blog&rdquo; menu entry is a few lines in the
YAML metadata block in <code>/content/blog/_index.md</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">---<span class="err">
</span><span class="err"></span>title: &#34;Blog&#34;<span class="err">
</span><span class="err"></span>menu: &#34;main&#34;<span class="err">
</span><span class="err"></span>weight: 4<span class="err">
</span><span class="err"></span>---</code></pre></div>
<p>The final piece is a bit of convenience: the <code>archetypes/default.md</code> provides a
skeleton markdown file for a new post:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-go-text-template" data-lang="go-text-template"><span class="x">+++
</span><span class="x">date = &#34;</span><span class="cp">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">.Date</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&#34;

</span><span class="x">+++</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which automatically populates some of the metadata to begin drafting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma">➜ hugo new blog/a-wonderful-blog-post.md
