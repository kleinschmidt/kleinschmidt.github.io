## Academic work

Academic CV: [(pdf)](https://kleinschmidt.github.io/cv/cv_kleinschmidt.pdf)

In my academic work, I focused on how the brain manages to efficiently
allocate representational resources in a world where the statistics of sensory
features changes from situation to situation. I'm particularly interested in how
the **structure** in this sensory non-stationarity makes it possible to adapt to
such changes more efficiently. **Speech perception** serves as an excellent
model organism, because the statistics of the speech signal depend both on
*what* is being said and *who* is saying it, both of which introduce highly
structured variability that listeners are sensitive to.

My work aimed to develop explicit, computational models of perception and
adaptation, with a particular emphasis on speech. I think that good theories and
models draw on insights from—and try to make connections between—neuroscience,
behavioral data, and broader computational-level cognitive modeling.

Topics that I've worked on or am interested in include: cognitive neuroscience
of learning and perception, perceptual category learning, phonetic
adaptation/recalibration, acquisition of phonetic categories, and cue
combination and complex acoustic feature extraction. I'm also particularly
interested in increasing awareness and appreciation of Bayesian methods for
modeling and—especially—data analysis.
