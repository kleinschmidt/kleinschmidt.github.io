I like making things
--------------------

Open-source projects I've contributed to include
[JuliaStats](https://github.com/JuliaStats/),
[Gadfly](https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl) (ggplot-style
visualization for Julia), [FAAV](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAAV) (now
[FAVE](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE)),
[latexdiff](https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff/), and, most
importantly, [lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits).

I [ride](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1622041) and tinker with my bikes.  I
started off as a fixie kid commuting to grad school through the Rochester
winter, and these days lean more towards bikepacking and cyclocross.  I love to
[build wheels](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17884357165792166/),
I will build you wheels if you want.

I like to cook, and especially to bake (including, yes, sourdough). I also have
a voracious sweet tooth, which is a dangerous combination. I love coffee and I
love beer.

Speaking of which, I [make my own
beer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/sets/72157631977977079/), and keep
track of my recipes ~~[here](https://www.brewtoad.com/users/15935)~~ [scraped
and archived here](https://github.com/kleinschmidt/brewtoad-scrape.jl).  I also
have a manual espresso machine from the 70's (just turned 50!!) that I
~~refurbished and [still can't make a decent shot
on](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/8173954507/in/set-72157631978802462)~~
~~possibly destroyed by shorting the heating element. You win some, you lose
some.~~ use every day.

I'm a knitter, and I think that wool is probably one of the most perfect
materials in existence.

Popular dependent measures of me include time-to-whiteboard-use,
maximum-audible-laughter-distance, and beard-to-hair-ratio.

I dabble at web design (I [made this website](/blog/hello-world/), and [this one
too](https://www.margaretbray.com/)).
