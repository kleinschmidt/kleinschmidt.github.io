  <h2>I like making things</h2>

  <p>Open-source projects I've contributed to include <a href="https://github.com/JuliaStats/">JuliaStats</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl">Gadfly</a> (ggplot-style visualization for Julia), <a href="https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAAV">FAAV</a> (now <a href="https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE">FAVE</a>), <a href="https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff/">latexdiff</a>, and, most importantly, <a href="https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits">lolcommits</a>.

  <p>I ride bikes (even, yes, through the Rochester winter).  My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/5238069139/">commuter bike</a> is a fixie I built up on a beater 10-speed Fuji frame with some pretty ostentatious red deep-v wheels, and when I feel like wrapping myself in spandex I have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/4917028821/">1993 Bianchi Campione</a>, which sports a fabulously 90s purple-and-black paint job.</p>

  <p>I like to cook, and especially to bake.  I also have a voracious sweet tooth, which is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/4348273517/">dangerous combination</a>.  I love coffee and I love beer.</p>

  <p>Speaking of which, I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/sets/72157631977977079/">make beer</a>, and keep track of my recipes <a href="https://www.brewtoad.com/users/15935">here</a>.  I also have a manual espresso machine from the 70's that I <del>refurbished and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dklein/8173954507/in/set-72157631978802462">still can't make a decent shot on</a></del> <del>possibly destroyed by shorting the heating element. You win some, you lose some.</del> use nearly every day.</p>

  <p>I'm the co-PI of the <a href="http://www.chigusakurumada.com/hop-lab-blog/">HOP Lab</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a knitter, and I think that wool is probably one of the most perfect materials in existence.</p>

  <p>Popular dependent measures of me include time-to-whiteboard-use, maximum-audible-laughter-distance, and beard-to-hair-ratio.</p>
