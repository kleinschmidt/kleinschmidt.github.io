  abstract: 'One of the persistent puzzles in understanding human speech perception
    is how listeners cope with talker variability. One thing that might help listeners
    is structure in talker variability: rather than varying randomly, talkers of the
    same gender, dialect, age, etc. tend to produce language in similar ways. Listeners
    are sensitive to this covariation between linguistic variation and socioindexical
    variables. In this paper I present new techniques based on ideal observer models
    to quantify (1) the amount and type of structure in talker variation (informativity
    of a grouping variable), and (2) how useful such structure can be for robust speech
    recognition in the face of talker variability (the utility of a grouping variable).
    I demonstrate these techniques in two phonetic domains—word-initial stop voicing
    and vowel identity—and show that these domains have diﬀerent amounts and types
    of talker variability, consistent with previous, impressionistic ﬁndings. An R
    package (phondisttools) accompanies this paper, and the source and data are available
    from osf.io/zv6e3.'

  abstract: According to an influential multiple-systems model of category learning,
    an implicit procedural system governs the learning of information-integration
    category structures, whereas a rule-based system governs the learning of explicit
    rule-based categories. Support for this idea has come in part from demonstrations
    that motor interference, in the form of inconsistent mapping between response
    location and category labels, results in observed deficits, but only for learning
    information-integration category structures. In this article, we argue that this
    response location manipulation results in a potentially more cognitively complex
    task in which the feedback is difficult to interpret. In one experiment, we attempted
    to attenuate the cognitive complexity by providing more information in the feedback,
    and demonstrated that this eliminates the observed performance deficit for information-integration
    category structures. In a second experiment, we demonstrated similar interference
    of the inconsistent mapping manipulation in a rule-based category structure. We
    claim that task complexity, and not separate systems, might be the source of the
    original dissociation between performance on rule-based and information-integration
    tasks.

  abstract: The mapping from phonetic categories to acoustic cue values is highly
    flexible, and adapts rapidly in response to exposure. There is currently, however,
    no theoretical framework which captures the range of this adaptation. We develop
    a novel approach to modeling phonetic adaptation via a belief-updating model,
    and demonstrate that this model naturally unifies two adaptation phenomena traditionally
    considered to be distinct.
