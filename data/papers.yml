  abstract: According to an influential multiple-systems model of category learning,
    an implicit procedural system governs the learning of information-integration
    category structures, whereas a rule-based system governs the learning of explicit
    rule-based categories. Support for this idea has come in part from demonstrations
    that motor interference, in the form of inconsistent mapping between response
    location and category labels, results in observed deficits, but only for learning
    information-integration category structures. In this article, we argue that this
    response location manipulation results in a potentially more cognitively complex
    task in which the feedback is difficult to interpret. In one experiment, we attempted
    to attenuate the cognitive complexity by providing more information in the feedback,
    and demonstrated that this eliminates the observed performance deficit for information-integration
    category structures. In a second experiment, we demonstrated similar interference
    of the inconsistent mapping manipulation in a rule-based category structure. We
    claim that task complexity, and not separate systems, might be the source of the
    original dissociation between performance on rule-based and information-integration
    tasks.

  abstract: The mapping from phonetic categories to acoustic cue values is highly
    flexible, and adapts rapidly in response to exposure. There is currently, however,
    no theoretical framework which captures the range of this adaptation. We develop
    a novel approach to modeling phonetic adaptation via a belief-updating model,
    and demonstrate that this model naturally unifies two adaptation phenomena traditionally
    considered to be distinct.
